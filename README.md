# Academic-Simulated-Nespresso-Market-Research

This project is a simulated academic market proposal for Nespresso, focusing on customer preferences, product inovation and sustainability The proposal includes survey design plans, sampling recommendations, and appropriate multivariate analysis techniques to address Nespresso’s research aims. Both Nespresso customers and competitors’ customers are considered, with a focus on actionable insights and justifiable methodology within a six-month timeframe.

1. Executive summary
   
2. Introduction: This section provides background on Nespresso’s goals, outlines the research aims from the client brief, and presents key research questions. Each question is tied to specific research objectives, focusing on identifying patterns and relationships between relevant variables.
   
3. Methodology: TThis study adopts a combination of exploratory, descriptive, and causal research designs. A mixed-method approach was implemented, where some research objectives were addressed using quantitative methods—such as multiple linear regression with dummy variables, one-way ANOVA, paired t-tests in a quasi-experimental design, and chi-square tests of association using tau-b—while other objectives were explored using qualitative techniques, like focus groups. This approach ensures a comprehensive analysis of both numerical trends and customer perceptions.
   
4. Data Collection: As the hypotheses were self-developed, the potential variables to collect were also self-identified and constructed. These variables were carefully grouped into primary and secondary, and further classified by type: continuous, categorical (ordinal or nominal), with some requiring scaling adjustments.
To collect data effectively, tailored questionnaires were designed that applied a combination of convenience, stratified, and cluster sampling techniques. A minimum sample size was calculated based on Nespresso’s customer segmentation, adjusted for estimated response rates, incentive-driven increases, geographic distribution of Nespresso users, and expected responses from non-Nespresso customers. This ensures the collected data is both statistically valid and representative.

5. Data Analysis and Hypothesis: This section explores each research objective alongside the relevant statistical technique used to test it. Rather than manual calculations, the focus is on how to interpret SPSS output tables, including key metrics such as significance levels, effect sizes, and model fit. Each analysis links back to the research question it addresses, helping to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

6. This report includes three tailored questionnaires, each addressing a specific research objective:

Consumer Preferences – Focused on taste profiles and interest in new blends or brewing technologies.

Product and Service Feedback – Targeting areas for improvement based on customer experience.

Sustainability Awareness – Assessing consumer perception and awareness of Nespresso’s sustainability initiatives.

Each questionnaire is designed to align with the research aims outlined in the client brief.

7. Timeline and Budget Details: This section outlines the estimated project timeline from proposal approval to final report submission and presentation. It also includes a proposed budget breakdown, detailing expected costs across stages such as data collection, survey and focus groups incentives to ensure efficient resource allocation within the client’s available budget.

8. Further Research and Recommendations: Beyond the core market research, this section offers recommendations and suggests additional areas for future research that could support Nespresso’s business growth. These include potential innovations, unexplored customer segments, and operational improvements that align with evolving market trends and consumer expectations.
